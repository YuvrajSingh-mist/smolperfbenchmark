//! `/proc/<pid>` footprint sampling for Linux and Android.
//!
//! `VmHWM` (equivalently `wait4`'s `ru_maxrss`) is a peak *resident* set, which on
//! a device with swap is not the peak the run required: the kernel can compress a
//! page into zram, dropping it out of RSS while the process still owns and needs
//! it. Both terms are kept because neither subsumes the other. `VmHWM` is exact,
//! maintained on the fault path so no interval can step over a transient, but
//! blind to swap; the sampled `VmRSS + VmSwap` sum sees swap but has to land near
//! the peak. There is no kernel watermark for swap, which is why this samples at
//! all. Measurements and rationale: docs/methodology/peak-memory-android.md.
