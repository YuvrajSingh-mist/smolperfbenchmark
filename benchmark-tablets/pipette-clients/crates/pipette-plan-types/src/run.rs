//! One cell as a client runs it: what an engine is handed ([`RunRequest`](crate::run::RunRequest)) and
//! what it answers with ([`RunResponse`](crate::run::RunResponse)) — the two halves of
//! `run(&RunRequest, …, ReadinessGate) -> Result<RunResponse>`.
//!
//! [`ClientRunSpec`](crate::ClientRunSpec) is the request's unbound sibling —
//! what a plan or a claim serves. Resolving one into a [`RunRequest`](crate::run::RunRequest) needs a
//! workspace catalog and artifact stores, so that step lives client-side in
//! `pipette-cli`; this module owns the shapes only.
//!
//! [`RunRequest`](crate::run::RunRequest) is here because both clients hold it: the Swift app mirrors
//! this crate, and independently arrived at the same declared-plus-located
//! pairing in its `ResolvedModel`. [`RunResponse`](crate::run::RunResponse) follows it for cohesion —
//! the two are one signature, and splitting them across crates is what made
//! the seam hard to read. It has no second implementation and no `Serialize`
//! (its `RunThermal` has none): a client that submits builds
//! [`BenchmarkSubmissionPayload`](crate::result::BenchmarkSubmissionPayload)
//! from it rather than sending it. The injected `ReadinessGate` stays with the
//! engines — a function type over them, not a shape.
